    <h2>State Voter Turnout/Ballots counted (2020 Primary Election) </h2>
    <h4>I chose to map the percentage of people (by state) that voted in the 2020 General Election. 
        I was interested in this because most of the election data that I see visually represented 
        is that of party affiliation, and what states, or parts of states, voted Democrat or Republican.
        I think that voter turnout is important for our democracy, making it important to track and present.
    </h4>
    <h4>I used a natural breaks categorization to get the best groupings. The other methods resulted in a decent amount
        states being placed just outside of groups, and the real trends were not clearly portrayed.
