    <h2>State Voter Turnout/Ballots counted (2020 Primary Election) </h2>
    <h3>I chose to map the percentage of people in a state that voted in the 2020 Primary Election. 
        I was interested in this because most of the election data that I see visually represented 
        is that of party affiliation, and what states or parts of states voted Democrat or Republican.
        I think that voter turnout is important for our democracy, making it important to track and present.
    </h3>
    <h3>I used a natural breaks categorization to get the best groupings. The other methods resulted in some states
        being placed just outside of groups, and the real trends were not clearly portrayed.
