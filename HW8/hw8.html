        <p>Question: What schools sit within the McGuire Nuclear Station Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ)</p>
     
        <p>The McGuire Nuclear Station is located in Huntersville, NC. It is ran by Duke Energy, and sits along 
            Lake Norman, its cooling source. The station has a designated EPZ zone of 10 miles, and a variety of
            disaster preparedness procedures have been developed for the people within it. For example, authorities 
            must be able to quickly distribute pills that block radiation from entering the thyroid to anyone within the 
            in the event of an emergency. Additionally, depending on the type of plant failure, all schools within the EPZ 
            must be able to be immediately evacuated, relocating all students and staff to pre-designated areas outside of the EPZ.
            I was interested in finding which schools are within the EPZ.

            I originally looked for a polygon or some other data of the station's EPZ, but could not find anything. To answer the question,
            I created a 10 mile radius buffer around the station point that I had downloaded from the internet. I looked for additional information on
            the exact origin of the EPZ. So, I then attempted to find a polygon to create a buffer around the plant as a rough estimate, but could not find 
            anything definitive due to issues in identifying the reactors or perimeter vs other buildings that make up the complex. As a result, I had to 
            settle on placing the buffer around the point located at what appears to be the center of the complex. After creating the buffer, I created an intersection
            involving the buffer, and points of public schools within North Carolina. This produced a layer of only the points found within the buffer.
